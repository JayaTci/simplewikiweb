  "content": "## Overview\n\n**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of a distributed system should behave.\n\nA **REST API** (also called a RESTful API or RESTful web API) is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.\n\n## Key Principles\n\n### Statelessness\n\nEach request from client to server must contain all of the information needed to understand the request. The server cannot store any session state on the server side between requests.\n\n### Client-Server Architecture\n\nREST separates the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns. This separation improves portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improves scalability by simplifying server components.\n\n### Uniform Interface\n\nREST APIs use a uniform interface that simplifies and decouples the architecture. This includes resource identification through URIs, manipulation of resources through representations, and self-descriptive messages.\n\n### Resource-Based\n\nIn REST, everything is a resource. Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Each resource can have multiple representations (JSON, XML, HTML).\n\n## HTTP Methods\n\nREST APIs commonly use these HTTP methods:\n\n- **GET** — Retrieve a resource\n- **POST** — Create a new resource\n- **PUT** — Update an existing resource\n- **PATCH** — Partially update a resource\n- **DELETE** — Remove a resource\n\n## Example API Design\n\n```\nGET    /api/articles          → List all articles\nGET    /api/articles/:id      → Get a specific article\nPOST   /api/articles          → Create a new article\nPUT    /api/articles/:id      → Update an article\nDELETE /api/articles/:id      → Delete an article\n```\n\n## Status Codes\n\nREST APIs use standard HTTP status codes:\n\n- **200 OK** — Successful request\n- **201 Created** — Resource created successfully\n- **400 Bad Request** — Invalid request data\n- **404 Not Found** — Resource not found\n- **500 Internal Server Error** — Server error\n\n## Building REST APIs\n\nPopular tools for building REST APIs:\n\n- **[[Express]]** with **[[Node.js]]** — The most popular combination for [[JavaScript]] APIs\n- **Django REST Framework** — Python-based REST API framework\n- **Spring Boot** — Java-based REST API framework\n\n## Related Technologies\n\n- **[[Express]]** — Framework for building REST APIs with Node.js\n- **[[Node.js]]** — Runtime environment for REST API servers\n- **[[JavaScript]]** — Language commonly used for REST API development\n- **[[Web Development]]** — REST APIs are fundamental to modern web development",
